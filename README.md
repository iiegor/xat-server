## Install
You can get the latest stable release from the [releases](https://github.com/iiegor/xat-server/releases) page. Once you've downloaded it, you are ready to run the following commands:
```sh
$ cd xat-server
$ npm install
```
Otherwhise, if you want to try the latest version of xat-server, you can clone the master branch but can have bugs because it's a development branch, so don't use it for production.

The server depends on [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/), [npm](http://npmjs.org/) and other packages that are downloaded and installed during the installation process.

## Run
Execute this command to start the server.
```sh
$ script/run
```
If you want to install a plugin, add it to ``packageDependencies`` in the package.json with the respective version.

Example:
```json
{
  ...
  "packageDependencies": {
    "my-plugin": "0.1.0"
  }
}
```
and run ``$ script/install``.
